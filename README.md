This repository contains the code and models for the VR app **Speak**, a simulated audience to help the world nail the perfect presentation. From conferences to classrooms to all-hands team meetings and everything in between, Speak empowers presenters by using a customizable and realistic virtual audience to build an immersive practice experience. With roaring crowds, detailed auditoriums, and a helpful timer, our app enables you to speak with confidence.

## Using Speak

Upon entering the scene, you are greeted with an audience and podium. You can start and stop the time by using the timer. The audience will also clap for you before and after your speech. 

We were inspired by our speech giving experiences, such as school presentations, research talks, and passionate rants to friends to create this product. This was most of our teamâ€™s first time using Unity and VR, so our greatest challenge was getting used to the environment. Overall, we learned a ton about the basics of Unity, Blender, and Animation. 

In the future, we hope to increase the realism of the scene, including adding more diverse characters and movements. We also hope to adjust the environment to fit various scenarios where someone might give a speech, such as in a meeting, intimate conversation, or classroom. We also plan to add immersive features such as a presentation and audio.
